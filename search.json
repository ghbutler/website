    "text": "I am a Research Analyst in the Banking section of the Department of Research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Prior to joining The Fed, I worked in international education in mainland China for about ten years. In 2020, I was an American Economic Association Summer Program fellow at Michigan State University, where I took PhD level coursework in Economics. I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with a B.A. in Business Economics and a minor in Japanese.\nMy primary interests are in health and labor economics and their intersections with race and inequality. My email address is gabriel.butler [at] gmail."

    "section": "",
    "text": "My main main research interests are in health and labor. I am particularly interested in Alzheimer’s disease and its spillover effects on family members, the economics of long term care for patients with neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the influence of neonatal and early childhood experience on development of the disease. I also have an interest in the Chinese economy and social problems in China.\nBefore pivoting to a career in academic research, I worked in education in mainland China. First I was an ESL teacher and I studied Chinese in my free time. Following that, I taught high school World History and served as teaching assistant for credit bearing courses in Economics offered through UCLA Extension in an international high school program that is overseen by UCLA in the city of Nanjing. I have also taught R programming and consider myself to be an R evangelist. (I made this website in RStudio!) In 2022, I started serving as a teaching assistant again for courses in Public Economics and Program Evaluation & Data Analysis.\nDuring the ten years I spent in China, I traveled widely and managed to visit over 30 cities. I have also lived in Japan (1 year), Mexico (1 summer), Finland (10 months) and the United Kingdom (about 6 months). I still speak and read Mandarin Chinese pretty well. My Japanese is extremely rusty. I know almost no Spanish or Finnish."
